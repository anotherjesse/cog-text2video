# cog-text2video

A Cog implementation:

- https://huggingface.co/cerspense/zeroscope_v2_XL 
- https://huggingface.co/cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w

Deployed at https://replicate.com/anotherjesse/zeroscope-v2-xl

This probably supports other models: https://huggingface.co/camenduru/potat1 and the original https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/modelscope-damo-text-to-video-synthesis

## Todo

- [ ] investigate vid2vid, img2vid support based on https://github.com/camenduru/Text-To-Video-Finetuning/ & https://github.com/ailostmedia/Potat1ALM/
- [ ] investigate other models
